Feature: Search
  As a Customer using a commerce website
  I want to be able to search for Products
  So that I can find the Product I am looking for quickly

  @wip
  Scenario: Search for Product
     Given that I am on "home page"
     And that there are products in the database
     When I enter "sony" to the search box
     And click button search
     Then the search results page should be displayed
     And the h1 should be "Search results for 'sony'"
     And 2 items should be returned as a result
     And I should see the text "2 item(s)"
     And I should see the dropdown "Show x per page" dropdown
     And I should be able to view as grid or list
     And I should be able to "sort by relevance, name or price"
     And I should see an image, title, reviews, price, add to cart, add to wishlist, add to compare"
