Feature: Search
  As a Customer using a commerce website
  I want to be able to search for Products
  So that I can find the Product I am looking for quickly

  # Scenario: Search for Product
  #   Given that I am on "home page"
  #   And that there are products in the database
  #   When I enter "sony" to the search box
  #   And click button search
  #   Then the search results page should be displayed
  #   And the h1 should be "Search results for 'sony'"
  #   And 2 items should be returned as a result
  #   And I should see the text "2 item(s)"
  #   And I should see the dropdown "Show x per page" dropdown
  #   And I should be able to view as grid or list
  #   And I should be able to "sort by relevance, name or price"
  #   And I should see an image, title, reviews, price, add to cart, add to wishlist, add to compare"
